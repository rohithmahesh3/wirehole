## What is this?

WireHole is a docker-compose project that combines WireGuard, PiHole, and Unbound to create a full or split-tunnel VPN that is easy to deploy and manage. This setup allows for a VPN with ad-blocking via PiHole and enhanced DNS privacy and caching through Unbound.

### Quickstart

#### 1. Install Docker 

```bash
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update \
  && sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg git wget apt-transport-https software-properties-common \
  && sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings \
  && curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg \
  && sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
```  

```bash
# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  "$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```  

```bash
# Install docker
sudo apt-get update \
  && sudo apt-get install docker-ce \
  docker-ce-cli \
  containerd.io \
  docker-buildx-plugin \
  docker-compose-plugin \
  && sudo groupadd docker \
  && sudo usermod -aG docker $USER \
  && newgrp docker \
  && sudo systemctl enable docker.service \
  && sudo systemctl enable containerd.service
```

#### 2. Deploy The Wirehole

To begin using WireHole, clone the repository and start the containers:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Clone the WireHole repository from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/m-karakus/wirehole.git

# Change directory to the cloned repository
cd wirehole

# Update the .env file with your configuration
nano .env  # Or use any text editor of your choice to edit the .env file

# Start the Docker containers
docker compose up
```

Remember to set secure passwords for  `WG_PASSWORD`, and `PIHOLE_PASSWORD` in your `.env` file.

## Environment Configuration Details

The `.env` file contains a series of environment variables that are essential for configuring the WireHole services within the Docker containers. Here is a detailed explanation of each variable:

### General Settings

*Update the `.env` file.*

- `MASTER` is your public ip or domain.
- `WG_PASSWORD` is wireguard UI password.
- `PIHOLE_PASSWORD` pihole UI password.

### WireGuard Settings

- After the `docker compose up` or deploy, open your browser and go to <http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:51821/>
- Login with your password, which is in the `.env`
- Create new connection keys/QR codes...

### Pi-hole Settings

- Connect to VPN with created client QR code or conf file and then go to this address on your browser <http://10.2.0.100/admin>
- Login with your password, which is in the `.env`

### Recommended Configuration / Split Tunnel

For a split-tunnel VPN, configure your WireGuard client `AllowedIps` to `10.3.0.0/24`, which will route only the web panel and DNS traffic through the VPN.
